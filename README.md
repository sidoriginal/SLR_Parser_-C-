# SLR_Parser_Cpp

Please access `main.cpp` for accessing the file and note the following points:

* Always start the starting symbol with "S".
* The null symbol is defined as "^" here.
* If production rules are given in the form like `A->B|ab`, count them as two different production rules and write them separately.
* Terminals should be of single character.
